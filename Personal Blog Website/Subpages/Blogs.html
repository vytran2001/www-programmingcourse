        <h1>Far From Home: What Study Abroad Has Taught Me.</h1>

            <p>Studying abroad is a new horizon, a dream of thousands of Vietnamese students and of course I am no exception. I imagined a beautiful memory of myself there until I actually experienced it. Everything was not as rosy as I thought and only those who have experienced it can fully understand. Here are some of the most honest experiences of my life and I hope these experiences help those of you who have, are intending and will study abroad in the future.</p>     
            <br>
            <h4><b>1. Independent Living</b></h4>
            <br>   
            <p> The first thing that life abroad gives me is the ability to be independent and probably most international students who choose this path know that being independent is a must that they will have to go through.</p>
                <img src="../Images/Post4.jpg" class="blog-pic" alt="Tankkari 4">
            <br> <p> There will be no meals prepared by your mother, no one will remind you to study and of course all personal activities you will have to do yourself. You will have to decide for yourself which school to attend or where to stay. Learn how to spend reasonably on your own and of course most international students have to find a job to cover living expenses. And when you go to work you will have to wake up very early to catch the bus and sometimes not have time to eat. When you are tired, frustrated or stressed because of work, there will be no one to complain or coo, but you have to learn to let go and stand up for yourself. <br> Such is the life of an international student. However, I always think that these are great experiences and it is because of it that I have grown more mature in life. </p>
            <br>
            <h4><b>2. Know how to appreciate love</b></h4>
            <br>
            <p>If above I put independent life as the first experience, it is that experience of being alone that makes me realize that love and friendship are extremely important and more than that, receiving someone's help. It's strange how happy it is to be in a difficult situation away from loved ones. <br> If in the past, when you lived with your parents, you received care and concern from AZ when you were sick, you were comforted and coddled, when you come here you will realize that you will not dare to complain much, even when you are seriously ill. You also have to pretend you don't have it so that your loved ones can feel secure about you. <br> Instead of spending time on other useless things, you will try to spend more time with your family because without them, your life in a foreign country will become lonely and difficult. Life has times of deadlock and fatigue, sometimes a simple question from a stranger makes you feel warm and extremely happy. That said, we will only see the warmest human love when alone in a foreign country and confront everything ourselves.</p>
            <img src="../Images/Valentine.jpg" class="blog-pic" alt="Valentine's Day">
            <br>
            <h4><b>3. Develop life skills</b></h4>
            <br>
            <p>As an international student you will have to learn how to integrate yourself in a country with a completely different culture and language. Here you have the opportunity to meet many students from many countries and in order not to feel out of place you will have to learn how to make a new friend the way they know you. You will have to learn how to manage and allocate time properly so that you can study well and work part-time to cover your life. The learning environment changes instead of you just working independently you will have to learn how to work in a team effectively. That's why when you have an international degree in hand, it's easier to get a job when you return home.</p>
            <br>
            <h4><b>4. Appreciate the labor force</b></h4>
            <br>
            <img src="../Images/Vocation.jpg" class="blog-pic" alt="Work Life in Finland">
            <p>If you have ever been a student who worked part-time, you will understand how it feels to make your own money. It will be even happier when you have to work hard to get those coins. <br> When I went to study abroad, I had to accept to work as a waitress at a restaurant, a pho restaurant with a salary of only €7-8/hour, and returned home at 1am with a tired body. It is these experiences that help me understand the hardships of my parents when they want me to study abroad to expand my knowledge.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><b>Endline</b></h3>
            <p>Above are my experiences and feelings when I was an international student. I believe you will see yourself in the story and experiences later on. However, in the era of technology 4.0, the study abroad industry has changed and improved more than before. There are already a few companies that allow students to apply for a completely online study abroad program that is simple, convenient and fast. To be able to choose a school by themselves, choose a major that suits their conditions and interests before studying abroad and be supported always in finding accommodation and jobs for international students when studying abroad. I wish you success and great experiences in your study abroad life. </p>
